She used investigative reporting and data journalist skills to document the realities of lynching in the South, often counter to what was reported in mainstream press.

Strachan broke the news that Keating used depositors’ savings for personal real estate ventures and stocks. After the Federal Home Loan Bank Board imposed a limit on savings and the FBI homed in on his company, Keating contributed $1.3 million to five U.S. senators’ campaigns in exchange for their support.

He has written about the physical conditions of incarceration, intergenerational incarceration and the disenfranchisement of people convicted of felonies, among other topics. Each article featured in the San Quentin News must be reviewed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation before publication, challenging Haines’ editorial control. In 2017, Haines won a Society of Professional Journalists Silver Heart award for encouraging “first time journalists to use their time in prison to report on the courts, the prisons and the conditions of incarceration,” the SPJ wrote in announcing Haines’ win. “With Haines’ encouragement and mentorship, their work has contributed to deeper understanding of the prison system by those both inside and outside the prison walls.”"))),o.a.createElement("div",{className:t.state.show4?"float-left image-wrapper":"image-wrapper"},o.a.createElement(f.a,{fluid:t.props.data.baranFreeman.childImageSharp.fluid,alt:"Madeleine Baran and Samara Freemark",style:{width:"100%"}}),o.a.createElement("button",{className:t.state.show4?"less-button":"more-button",onClick:function(){return t.handleClick4()}},o.a.createElement("span",{className:"sr-only"},t.state.show2?"Less":"More")),o.a.createElement("p",{className:"flipper-title",style:{fontSize:"1rem"}},"Madeleine Baran and Samara Freemark"),o.a.createElement("div",{className:t.state.show4?"show expanded-text":"hide expanded-text"},o.a.createElement("h3",null,"Madeleine Baran and Samara Freemark"),o.a.createElement("p",null,"Madeleine Baran and Samara Freemark hold truth to power.

When Roberts founded the TransGriot in 2006, she was acutely aware of the racism in the LGBTQ community and began using the blog to champion critiques of anti-trans sentiment and violence, while uplifting trans voices. “There weren’t really any blogs talking about the issues from a Black trans perspective,” she said in an interview with Queerty in 2019, “I went with the, ‘You want it done right? You gotta do it yourself.’” Roberts regularly utilized the platform to address power disparities and to call out larger media entities for their poor coverage of the murders of trans people. Her work as both a journalist and advocate pioneered conversations and legislative change. In that same Queerty interview, Roberts noted that for perhaps the first in modern history, trans people have the opportunity for intergenerational conversations that can help allow for new approaches to solving institutional barriers that exist for the community.
